    //     In this paper, we will review the recent studies that have used Siamese
    //     networks, and the potential of these networks in improving all types of
    //     models will be reviewed. In the initial parts, we will discuss the basics
    //     of Siamese networks and introduce different loss functions that are used
    //     to train Siamese networks. Subsequently, in the main part of the paper
    //     we will focus on highlighting the capabilities of Siamese networks. For

    //     we introduce the unique features of these networks that help to overcome

    //     in which Siamese networks have been used. To provide the mentioned
    //     information, 180 papers in the field of deep learning were studied and
    //     categorized according to the way of using Siamese networks. Using this
