		name: "FCN Semantic Segmentation",
		description: `One of the Semantic segmentation algorithms is FCN that uses a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) i.e. you stack a bunch of convolutional layers in a encoder-decoder fashion. The encoder downsamples the image using strided convolution giving a compressed feature representation of the image, and the decoder upsamples the image using methods like transpose convolution to give the segmented output`,

		name: "Denoising AutoEncoders",
		description: `Autoencoders present an efficient way to learn a representation of your data, which helps with tasks such as dimensionality reduction or feature extraction. You can even train an autoencoder to identify and remove noise from your data. The purpose of a DAE is to remove noise. You can also think of it as a customised denoising algorithm tuned to your data.`,

		description: `DCGAN, or Deep Convolutional GAN, is a generative adversarial network architecture. It uses a couple of guidelines, in particular:
		Replacing any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided convolutions (generator).
		Using batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator.
		Removing fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures.
		Using ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses tanh.
		Using LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layer.`,
